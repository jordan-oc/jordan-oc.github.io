        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Jordan O'Connell. I'm a recent college graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and I'm looking to get into the tech field.

            Before pursuing my degree, I served in the Air Force, where I gained valuable experience working in a team environment and honed my problem-solving skills. After completing my service, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and enrolled in college to study Computer Science.
            
            During my time in school, I learned programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and gained experience in software development, database design, and web development.
            
            Now that I have completed my degree, I am eager to put my knowledge and skills to use in the tech industry. I am particularly interested in roles that involve software development, data analysis, and machine learning. I am a quick learner and a dedicated worker, and I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and work alongside talented professionals.
            
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out!</p>
