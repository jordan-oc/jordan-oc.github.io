    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I have a few hobbies that I enjoy like <strong>the outdoors</strong>, like hiking and mountaing biking.
        I recently got into mountain biking during covid in 2020 and Ive been hiking for quite some time. 
        Heres a link to a popular mountain biking website,
        <a href="https://www.pinkbike.com/" 
        title="pinbike.com">Pink Bike</a>. 
        Its a good website for people that enjoy mountain biking,
        as they have news, a youtube channel and classified where you
        can find some deals on used parts.  
        As I also enjoy Hiking, I have a California Poppy pass,
        which allows access to many State Parks for a one time fee which can save money in the long run.
